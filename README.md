# SkillBridge

This project was carried out as part of the TechLabs “Digital Shaper Program” in Hamburg (winter term 2022/2023) — tracks: User Experience & Web Development.


## About

SkillBridge is an online platform that enables young adults to find the perfect apprenticeship position based on their skills and interests. By completing a 360-degree assessment they can match open positions and be found by employers that are looking for a specific motivation in candidates. 

Fundament of the WerbDev work was the wireframes provided by the UX team members. 
The Web-Application was built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node) completed by SCSS.
